Project plan:
	-Create a song class that contains variables for:
		+ artists of type string
		+ titles of type string
		+ lyrics dynamic array of type string (will be a vector)
		+ a function to insert lyrics of that returns nothing

	-Once class is made, a dynamic array of type song will be made
	 (this will be made using the vector function)
		+ This song dynamic array is what will be used to store
		  all the songs in the database
		+ The lyrics dynamic array in each song will be where
		  all the strings for the lyrics will be stored

	-A hashtable is how I plan on dealing with the word the user
	 is searching for.
		+ Though it will require a large amount of memory, the
		  lyrics for songs will be hashed & sorted in the hashtable
		  based on their hash function.
		+ Collisions: Collisions will be dealt with using a second
		  hash function to jump using the key (similar to lab 9)
		+ Will need to check if all spots are full, if so, will
		  have to expand the hashtable, and rehash all values
		+ Each index will contain an array of structs
		+ There will be 11 available spots for the array of structs
		+ This will serve as a top 10 list. The 11th spot is to
		  compare the word frequency of the rest of the list of
		  songs to the current list. If a song has a higher frequency
		  than the current minimum, the two songs will be swapped.
		+ The struct contains a variable called frequency of type 
		  integer for the number of times the word has appeared,
		  and another integer for the index of the song in the
		  vector of songs (to be able to search for the song in
		  the array of type song).

	-The actual search requires the program to:
		+ Make sure the word is alpha only
		+ Hashes the string and finds the index for word
		+ Retrieves the top 10 list & loops to find the index
		  for each instance of the word
		+ While looping, goes the the index in the vector of songs
		  for the first song in the top 10 list.
		+ Linearly searches the song for the word & prints out each
		  instance of the word, 5 words before & 5 words after.
		+ Linear search will occur in the vector of lyrics each
		  song has.
		+ In order to print lyrics with correct punctuation a check
		  will have to be made to make sure the alpha only version
		  of the lyric matches the word searched. If the two match
		  printing will proceed.
