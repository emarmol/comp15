Cry For Help 
She's taken my time
convinced me she's fine
but when she leaves I'm not so sure.
It's always the same: she's playing her game
and when she goes I feel to blame.
Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as it seems.
Why don't I feel a cry for help?
Why don't I hear a cry for help?
I wandered around the streets of this town
trying to find sense in it all.
The rain on my face it covers the trace
of all the tears I've had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions
why must we never break down and cry?
All that I need is to cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.
All I can do is cry for help.
No need to feel ashamed
release the pain and cry for help.
Cry for help is all I need
all I need is a cry for help.
Cry for help is all I need
all I need is a cry for help.
Why must we hide emotions?
Why can we never break down and cry?
All that I need is cry for help.
I will be there when you cry for help.
Why don't I hear a cry for help?
All that I need is cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.
All I can do is cry for help.
All that I need is cry for help.
I will be there when you cry for help.
Is it so hard to cry for help?

Hold Me In Your Arms 
We've been trying for a long time to say what we want to say
But feelings don't come easy to express in a simple way.
But we all have feelings
we all need loving
And who would be the fool to say that if you -
Hold me in your arms
I won#t feel better?
If you hold me in your arms
we can brave this storm together.
We both know there's a problem
a problem that we've got to face.
So put your trust in me
lover no-one's ever gonna take your place.
'Cos we all have a problem
we all have fears
But there's always got to be a way.
Yes
we all have feelings
we all need loving
And you would be a fool to say that if you -
Hold me in your arms
I won't feel better?
If you hold me in yor arms
we can brave this storm together.
You only have to hold me
touch me to make me feel so good
You only have to hold me
feel me
to make me feel the way
you know I should.
Hold me in your arms
hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
hold me in your arms
When you gonna hold me in your arms
hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
hold me in your arms

My Arms Keep Missing You 
You know I've been so lonely every night since you went away
Would you let me down any night
is that the way you're made
girl ?
I keep telling myself it's alright even though I cry
There's no question why
how could I be happy when -
My arms keep missing you
who's been kissing you since you went away ?
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing you'd come back today.
You said you wouldn't hurt me any way and I believed in you
We said we'd trust each other every day
we'd never be untrue.
But I keep thinking you're telling lies even though I try
There's no question why
how can I be happy when -
My arms keep missing you
who's been kissing you since you went away ? . . .
You know I've been so lonely every night since you went away
. . .
My arms keep missing you
who's been kissing you since you went away ? . . .
My arms keep missing you
who's been kissing you since you went away ? . . .

Never Gonna Give You Up 
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
CHORUS
Never gonna give you up, 
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna run around and desert you,
Never gonna make you cry, 
Never gonna say goodbye,
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see 
(CHORUS)
CHORUSCHORUS
(Ooh give you up)
(Ooh give you up)
(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give
(give you up)
(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give
(give you up)
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it 
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Strong Man 
My heart starts breaking 
When I think of making 
A plan to let you go 
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow 
I
m gonna let you know 
But when I think about leaving 
I think about losing 
The only love I ever knew 
Every time I think of you 
 My heart starts aching 
My hands keep shaking 
And you know
 you know
 you know 
 It would take a strong
 strong man 
To ever let you go 
to ever let you go
To ever let you go 
My heart
s been hurting 
When I see you flirting 
Every night out on the floor 
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow 
You
ll grow to love me more 
But whenever we
re together 
I could leave you never 
Even though you treat me cruel 
Every time I look at you 
 repeat
 repeat 
I tried to resist you 
When you
re gone
 all I ever do is miss you 
Anyone in love would know 
Anyone with half a heart 
Could never let you go 
But I when I think about leaving 
I think about losing 
The only girl I ever loved 
Can
t you tell me why do you hurt me 
I guess some people never see 
Especially a fool like me 
 repeat 
 repeat 
To ever let you go 
I
ll never let you go 
To ever let you go

The Ones You Love 
children cry on the street
they dont have enough to eat
mothers wait for days on end
a hopeless situation they can't mend
is it good for you? is it good for me?
i don't know how the world can sleep
it's just not right to close the door turn out the light
they'd better be the ones you love
the children ought to get some love
if no one else should ever get enough
they'd better be the ones you love
daddy waits there in a line a little work
he hopes to find something wrong
with times like these it's enough to bring a man down to his knees
is it good for you? is it good for me?
i dont know how the world can sleep
it can't be right to close the door turn off the light
(repeat chorus then repeat chorus again)
thinking of the children
you better be thinking about the children better be,
you better be, better be the ones you love better be,
you better be, better be the ones you love yeah,
yeah yeah (repeat bridgr, repeat chorus, fade)

Together Forever 
If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day
So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
Chorus:
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you
If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you
There ain't no mistaking
It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
Chorus:
So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
Chorus 3x

Whenever You Need Somebody 
I'll bring my love to you
I'll bring my lave to you.
I've been stood up and messed around and taken for a fool
But next time round I'm gonna change the rules.
And I don't care about things that people say
It's you I think about each and every day.
It's much too late for you to change your ways
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay.
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
Call me
I'll be around!
Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna be with you.
Lost inside your love is where I wanna be
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me.
Time and time you say you wanna be free
And you can have some fun
that's okay with me.
You will never know just how good I feel
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real.
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
. . .
I'll bring my love to you
I iust wanna be with you.
I'll bring my love to you
I iust wanna be with you.
It's much too late for you to change your ways
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay.
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
. . .
Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna be with you.
Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna be with you.

When I Fall In Love 
When i fall in love if will be forever
or i'll never fall in lovein a restless world like this is
love is ended before it's begun
and too many moonlight kisses
seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When i give my heart it will be completely
or i'll never give my heart
and the moment i can feel
that you feel that way too
is when i fall in love with you
Maybe i'm old fashioned feeling as i do
mabye i am living in the past
but when i meet the right one
i know that i'll be true
my first love will be my last
